    <p >A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or
      input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback.
      This feedback is shown on a video
      display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often
      augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of
      feedback, including haptic technology.
      Computer games are not all video games—for example text adventure games, chess, and so on do not depend upon a
      graphics display.

      Originally a niche market, video games have recently gained the attention of mainstream society. When they were first created, video games were very much a minority played thing due to the cost and impracticality of the large computers necessary for playing them. However, upon the creation and spreading of arcades, many of the youth of that time quickly became avid gamers. Later, upon introduction of the home console, games became accessible to the average person and the video game market boomed. These days, the market is huge and a remarkable percent of the world's population has played video games at some point in their life. Upon the hitting of COVID, due to the fact that you can play video games in the comfort of your homes along with your friends, the popularity of video games surged once again.

    <h4 id="Development">Development</h4>
    <hr id="solid">
    <p >In the 2000s, the core industry centered on "AAA" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental
      games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent
      video game development (or indie games)
      to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been
      increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player
      demographics towards casual gaming
      and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has
      estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the
      size of the 2019 global
      music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.
    </p>
  <h4 id="Platforms">Platforms</h4>
  <p>Video games require a platform, a specific combination of electronic components or computer hardware and associated software, to operate.[32] The term system is also commonly used. Games are typically designed to be played on one or a limited number of platforms, and exclusivity to a platform is used as a competitive edge in the video game market.[33] However, games may be developed for alternative platforms than intended, which are described as ports or conversions. These also may be remasters - where most of the original game's source code is reused and art assets, models, and game levels are updated for modern systems - and remakes, where in addition to asset improvements, significant reworking of the original game and possibly from scratch is performed.[34]
    The list below is not exhaustive and excludes other electronic devices capable of playing video games such as PDAs and graphing calculators.
  </p> 
  <h4 id="Computer-game">Computer game</h4>
  <p>Most computer games are PC games, referring to those that involve a player interacting with a personal computer (PC) connected to a video monitor.[35] Personal computers are not dedicated game platforms, so there may be differences running the same game on different hardware. Also, the openness allows some features to developers like reduced software cost,[36] increased flexibility, increased innovation, emulation, creation of modifications or mods, open hosting for online gaming (in which a person plays a video game with people who are in a different household) and others. A gaming computer is a PC or laptop intended specifically for gaming, typically using high-performance, high-cost components. In additional to personal computer gaming, there also exist games that work on mainframe computers and other similarly shared systems, with users logging in remotely to use the computer.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Home-console">Home Console</h4>
  <p>A console game is played on a home console, a specialized electronic device that connects to a common television set or composite video monitor. Home consoles are specifically designed to play games using a dedicated hardware environment, giving developers a concrete hardware target for development and assurances of what features will be available, simplifying development compared to PC game development. Usually consoles only run games developed for it, or games from other platform made by the same company, but never games developed by its direct competitor, even if the same game is available on different platforms. It often comes with a specific game controller. Major console platforms include Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Handheld-console">Handheld Console</h4>
  <p>A handheld gaming device is a small, self-contained electronic device that is portable and can be held in a user's hands. It features the console, a small screen, speakers and buttons, joystick or other game controllers in a single unit. Like consoles, handhelds are dedicated platforms, and share almost the same characteristics. Handheld hardware usually is less powerful than PC or console hardware. Some handheld games from the late 1970s and early 1980s could only play one game. In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of handheld games used cartridges, which enabled them to be used to play many different games. The handheld console has waned in the 2010s as mobile device gaming has become a more dominant factor.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Arcade-Video-Game">Arcade Video Game</h4>
  <p> 
    An arcade video game generally refers to a game played on an even more specialized type of electronic device that is typically designed to play only one game and is encased in a special, large coin-operated cabinet which has one built-in console, controllers (joystick, buttons, etc.), a CRT screen, and audio amplifier and speakers. Arcade games often have brightly painted logos and images relating to the theme of the game. While most arcade games are housed in a vertical cabinet, which the user typically stands in front of to play, some arcade games use a tabletop approach, in which the display screen is housed in a table-style cabinet with a see-through table top. With table-top games, the users typically sit to play. In the 1990s and 2000s, some arcade games offered players a choice of multiple games. In the 1980s, video arcades were businesses in which game players could use a number of arcade video games. In the 2010s, there are far fewer video arcades, but some movie theaters and family entertainment centers still have them.</p>
  <h4 id="Browser">Browser Game</h4>
  <p>A browser game takes advantages of standardizations of technologies for the functionality of web browsers across multiple devices providing a cross-platform environment. These games may be identified based on the website that they appear, such as with Miniclip games. Others are named based on the programming platform used to develop them, such as Java and Flash games.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Mobile">Mobile Game</h4>
  <p>With the introduction of smartphones and tablet computers standardized on the iOS and Android operating systems, mobile gaming has become a significant platform. These games may utilize unique features of mobile devices that are not necessary present on other platforms, such as accelerometers, global positing information and camera devices to support augmented reality gameplay.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Cloud">Cloud Gaming</h4>
  <p>Cloud gaming requires a minimal hardware device, such as a basic computer, console, laptop, mobile phone or even a dedicated hardware device connected to a display with good Internet connectivity that connects to hardware systems by the cloud gaming provider. The game is computed and rendered on the remote hardware, using a number of predictive methods to reduce the network latency between player input and output on their display device. For example, the Xbox Cloud Gaming and PlayStation Now platforms use dedicated custom server blade hardware in cloud computing centers.</p>
  <h4 id="Virtual">Virtual Reality</h4>
  <p>Virtual reality (VR) games generally require players to use a special head-mounted unit that provides stereoscopic screens and motion tracking to immerse a player within virtual environment that responds to their head movements. Some VR systems include control units for the player's hands as to provide a direct way to interact with the virtual world. VR systems generally require a separate computer, console, or other processing device that couples with the head-mounted unit</p>
  <h4 id="Emulation">Emulation</h4>
  <p>An emulator enables games from a console or otherwise different system to be run in a type of virtual machine on a modern system, simulating the hardware of the original and allows old games to be played. While emulators themselves have been found to be legal in United States case law, the act of obtaining the game software that one does not already own may violate copyrights. However, there are some official releases of emulated software from game manufacturers, such as Nintendo with its Virtual Console or Nintendo Switch Online offerings</p>
  <h4 id="Backward">Backward Compatability</h4>
  <p>Backward compatibility is similar in nature to emulation in that older games can be played on newer platforms, but typically directly though hardware and build-in software within the platform. For example, the PlayStation 2 is capable of playing original PlayStation games simply by inserting the original game media into the newer console, while Nintendo's Wii could play Nintendo GameCube titles as well in the same manner.
  </p>
  <h4 id="Types">Types of video games</h4>
  <p>Video games come in many different genres. Some of these include: <ul>
   <li> Adventures</li>
   <li>Racing</li>
   <li>Multiplayer shooters</li>
  </ul>
