    <p id="para">A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or
        input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback.
        This feedback is shown on a video
        display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are often
        augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types of
        feedback, including haptic technology.
        Computer games are not all video games—for example text adventure games, chess, and so on do not depend upon a
        graphics display.

    <P id="para">Most of the world plays video games right now and they have become immensely popular recently. They
        have been around since the 1970s and have been becoming more and more mainstream in the time since. When COVID
        came about and everyone was stuck at
        home, video games gained immense popularity as people had nothing else to do.

    <h2 id="h2">Development</h2>
    <hr id="solid">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p id="para">In the 2000s, the core industry centered on "AAA" games, leaving little room for riskier, experimental
        games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for independent
        video game development (or indie games)
        to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has been
        increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player
        demographics towards casual gaming
        and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game market has
        estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times the
        size of the 2019 global
        music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.
