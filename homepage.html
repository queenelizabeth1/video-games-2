        <p id="para">A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user
            interface
            or
            input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual
            feedback.
            This feedback is shown on a video
            display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Video games are
            often
            augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and sometimes with other types
            of
            feedback, including haptic technology.
            Computer games are not all video games—for example text adventure games, chess, and so on do not depend
            upon
            a
            graphics display.

        <P id="para">Most of the world plays video games right now and they have become immensely popular recently.
            They
            have been around since the 1970s and have been becoming more and more mainstream in the time since. When
            COVID
            came about and everyone was stuck at
            home, video games gained immense popularity as people had nothing else to do.

        <p id="para">In the 2000s, the core industry centered on "AAA" games, leaving little room for riskier,
            experimental
            games. Coupled with the availability of the Internet and digital distribution, this gave room for
            independent
            video game development (or indie games)
            to gain prominence into the 2010s. Since then, the commercial importance of the video game industry has
            been
            increasing. The emerging Asian markets and mobile games on smartphones in particular are altering player
            demographics towards casual gaming
            and increasing monetization by incorporating games as a service. As of 2020, the global video game
            market
            has
            estimated annual revenues of US$159 billion across hardware, software, and services. This is three times
            the
            size of the 2019 global
            music industry and four times that of the 2019 film industry.
