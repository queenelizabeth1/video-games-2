    <p> Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a
        set of agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game
        mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it.
        Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires
        charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and
        one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game
        economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is
        responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns
        like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles.
        There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique
        shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. Different agents allow
        players to find more ways to plant the Spike and style on enemies with scrappers, strategists,
        and hunters of every description. It currently offers 16 agents to choose from.
        They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru,
        Astra, KAY/O, and Chamber.

    <p><b>Unrated:</b> In the standard non-ranked mode, the match is played as best of 25 - the first team to win 13 rounds wins the match. The attacking team has a bomb-type device called the Spike. They must deliver and activate the Spike on one of the multiple specified locations (bomb sites). If the attacking team successfully protects the activated Spike for 45 seconds it detonates, destroying everything in a specific area, and they receive a point.[3] If the defending team can deactivate the spike, or the 100-second round timer expires without the attacking team activating the spike, the defending team receives a point.
<br>
<br>
    <b>Competitive:</b> Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each player after 5 games are played. Before you can play in competitive games, you will need to win 10 unrated matches beforehand
<br>
<br>
    <b>Spike rush:</b> In the Spike Rush mode, the match is played as best of 7 rounds - the first team to win 4 rounds wins the match. Players begin the round with all abilities fully charged except their ultimate, which charges twice as fast as in standard games. All players on the attacking team carry a spike, but only one spike may be activated per round. Guns are randomized in every round and every player begins with the same gun. Ultimate point orbs in the standard game are present, but there are multiple power-up orbs instead

<br>
<br>
<p>There are a large variety of playable agents available in the game. Agents are divided into 4 roles: Duelists, Sentinels, Initiators, and Controllers. Each agent has a different role which indicates how the agent is usually played.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Duelist:</b> Duelists specialize in attacking and entering a bomb site for the team. Duelists mainly create space for their team while entering onto a site, giving their teammates information, and making entering a site easier. Their abilities tend to consist of flashes which blind enemies, and movement-based abilities that allow for them to cover large distances faster than other agents. This type of ability kit allows for duelists to shine best when they are able to catch players off guard and get impact frags. On attack, duelists are most often expected to play forward, leading the attack. They are expected to be in front of everyone to get opening picks on enemies since their abilities often give them a competitive advantage when gunfighting an enemy.
On defense, duelists will be holding choke points where enemies try to enter sites. Due to the mobility in their kits, they are able to get a pick and reposition, giving their team a numbers advantage.Examples of duelists are Jett and Phoenix
</p>
<br>
<p><b>Sentinel:</b> Sentinels are the defensive line, which specializes in locking down sites and protecting teammates from enemies. Their abilities mainly consist of static 'objects' that are obstacles to the enemies. These objects can give the team valuable information and/or deal damage.
On attack, sentinels can use their abilities to cut off certain parts of the map or set up 'objects' that can ensure the enemy cannot flank without being noticed. On defense, sentinels can use their abilities to slow enemies from entering a site. This provides valuable time for the sentinels' team members to come and provide defensive support. Examples: Cypher and Killjoy</p>
